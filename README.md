# Smash-A-Diglet

Created an IOS/Android video game based on the concept of whack-a-mole with pokemon diglet. With conditional rendering, each component will either show diglett or the ground randomly. There is a built in timer which is set at 15 seconds at the moment, once the timer goes to 0 the game over screen will appear. User will have the chance to replay the game in the end by pressing the 'play again' button. There is also a point system base on the amount of diglett was smashed! My highest score was 32, try and beat me today!
